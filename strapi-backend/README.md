# Strapi Backend for FlexGen.ai

This directory contains the Strapi backend for the FlexGen.ai website.

## Setup Instructions

   ```
   cd strapi-backend
   ```

2. Create a new Strapi project:

   ```

   Note: The `--quickstart` flag will set up your project with SQLite and automatically run it.
