Here are the complete **Git commands** to create (checkout) a new branch and push it to your remote (e.g., Bitbucket):

## ✅ Git Commands to Create & Push a New Branch

```bash
# Step 1: Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b your-branch-name

# Step 2: Add and commit your changes (if any)
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# Step 3: Push the new branch to Bitbucket (or any remote)
git push -u origin your-branch-name
```

### 📝 Example

```bash
git checkout -b feature/login-page
git add .
git commit -m "Add login page UI"
git push -u origin feature/login-page
```

### 🧠 Explanation:

* `git checkout -b`: Creates and switches to a new branch.
* `git push -u origin`: Pushes the branch and sets it to track the remote branch for future `git push`/`git pull`.

Let me know if you want to list branches or switch back to main/master.
